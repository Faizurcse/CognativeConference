    heading: "How does AI make predictive maintenance better?",
    detail: "Artificial Intelligence has an impact on making maintenance more proactive by looking at data from machines to guess when they might break down before it happens. This lets companies do upkeep when it’s best, cutting down on time machines that aren’t working and making them last longer. Machine learning models that use AI play a key role in this, which makes AI and Robotics a crucial part of Industry 4.0. The Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning    events at the conference explore these groundbreaking ways to use the technology.",
